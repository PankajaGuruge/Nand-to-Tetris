# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris

Welcome to the repository for the "Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris" project-centered course. This course is an exciting journey that takes you from the basics of logic gates all the way to building a fully functional computer system, including software. 

## About the Course

This project-centered course provides a unique opportunity to understand how computers work from the ground up. Beginning with basic logic gates and gradually progressing to more complex components, you will learn to design and implement each part of a computer system. By the end of the course, you will have built a computer capable of running simple programs.

## Contents

This repository contains all the materials you need to complete the course, including:

- **Lecture slides**: Detailed presentations to guide you through each module.
- **Project assignments**: Hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning.
- **Example code**: Sample implementations to help you understand concepts better.
- **Additional resources**: Supplementary materials to deepen your understanding.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions provided in the README files of each module. Make sure to check the prerequisites and install any necessary software before beginning.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of computer construction. You will start with the basics of Boolean logic and gradually move on to more advanced topics such as machine language programming and operating systems.
